# Auto-Reg BMSCE

This code is a Python script that automates the process of registering for courses on the BMS College of Engineering's First Year portal using the Selenium WebDriver. The script prompts the user to input their login credentials and navigates to the registration page. Then, it selects the desired courses using their respective XPATHs and clicks on the buttons to confirm the selection. The script makes use of the WebDriverWait class to wait for the web elements to be visible and clickable before interacting with them. This script could be useful for students who wish to register for courses quickly and efficiently without having to manually navigate the registration process.
