# Auto-RegCourses

This code is a Python script that automates the process of registering for courses on my College's First Year portal using the Selenium WebDriver. The script prompts the user to input their login credentials along with the courses of your choice, then it navigates to the registration page and  selects the specified courses using their respective XPATHs and clicks on the buttons to confirm the selection. The script makes use of the WebDriverWait class to wait for the web elements to be visible and clickable before interacting with them. This script could be useful for students who wish to register for courses quickly and efficiently without having to manually navigate the registration process.
